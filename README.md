Welcome to **VoxaCommunications-NetNode**, a next-generation decentralized network inspired by TOR but with more: secure request splitting, dynamic routing, and a built-in crypto chain. We’re building a scalable, privacy-focused system, and we need your help!

> [!WARNING]
> VoxaCommunications-NetNode is still in **active development**, and is not ready for a mainnet deploy. For help on testing, refer to the [Testing Guide](TESTING.md)

## Project Vision
VoxaCommunications aims to create a fast, secure, and decentralized network for communication and data transfer. Unlike traditional systems, we split requests into hashed parts, route them through a network of Nodes and Relays, and reassemble them securely. A lightweight crypto chain ensures trust and incentives.

## Key Components
- **Registry**: A centralized directory of trusted Nodes (to be decentralized later).
- **Nodes**: Handle routing, generate route maps, and verify Relays via pings.
- **Relays**: Lightweight data forwarders for efficient transmission.
- **Request Splitting**: Requests are split into parts, each with hashes, for secure delivery.
- **Crypto Chain**: A decentralized ledger for trust, incentives, or data integrity.

## Why Contribute?
- Work on cutting-edge tech: decentralized routing, blockchain, and secure communication.
- Join a passionate community shaping the future of privacy-focused networks.
- Gain experience in distributed systems, cryptography, and network protocols.

## How to Get Involved
1. **Star this repo** to show your support!
2. Check out our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for tasks like:
   - Implementing request splitting with hash verification.
   - Designing Node routing logic or crypto chain consensus.
   - Writing tests for Relay pings.
3. Join our [Telegram](https://t.me/voxacommunications) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/EDtPX5E4D4) to discuss ideas and collaborate.
4. Open an Issue to suggest features or report bugs.

## Current Priorities
- Prototype request splitting and reassembly.
- Design a lightweight crypto chain for Node/Relay trust.
- Secure the centralized Registry with cryptographic signatures.
